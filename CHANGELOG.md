## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- Initial public release of the Agent Memory Protocol (AMP).
- JSON Schema 2020-12 specification covering 5 operations
  (`remember`, `recall`, `forget`, `merge`, `expire`) over 4 memory types
  (semantic, episodic, procedural, emotional).
- Five backend adapters implementing the `MemoryStore` protocol:
  `sqlite-vec`, `mem0`, `Letta`, `Cognee`, and `pgvector`.
- Memory router with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF, k=60) and an optional
  1-hop graph boost for cross-store recall fusion.
- FSM-based procedural-memory backend powered by `pytransitions`.
- Asynchronous STM &harr; LTM transformer for short-term to long-term
  memory consolidation.
- `amp` CLI exposing `remember`, `recall`, and `forget` subcommands.
- Apache-2.0 licensed protocol and reference implementation.
- Microbenchmark harness, adversarial-fusion sub-experiment, and a
  16-scenario cross-adapter conformance suite.
- 290+ tests passing by default; `ruff` and `mypy --strict` clean.
